## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
The first thing that I want to say about this challenge is that it was a challenge! hahaha. The things that I struggles with the most was the hamburger menu, and this made me realized that I did not have much experience doing this kind of menus so that is something I have to keep practicing. I also struggles and got to practice alot with the grid placement and and versatility that the grid provides respect tp flexbox.


### Continued development

As I mentioned before I definitely will keep on working with the grid and study up a bit more since I had a hard time with it. I also would like to imrove on the hamburger menu or even menus in general so that is something that I will practice more.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I always use it as a quick reference when I want to know about properties like Grid and Flexbox
